The README covers the basics. This page collects the
longer examples and the notes that did not fit up front.

curl -X POST localhost:3000/api/bookmarks \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"url": "https://example.com", "tags": ["reading"]}'
```

- REST endpoints: list / create / delete / search
